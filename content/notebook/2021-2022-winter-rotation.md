**Introduction:**    
Notebook for rotation in Dr. Wei Li lab. It'll log notes, ideas and inspirations from papers I read; Save a copy of bioinformatic and statistical analysis I did for reproducible science!

- Most CpG dinucleotides are methylated with the exception of those within in CpG islands (CGIs), which are usually unmethylated. 
- Human have ~30,000 CGIs. More than 10,000 CGIs occur at genes' promoters and nearly always remain unmethylated. 
- In mammalian genomes, CGIs are typically 300â€“3,000 base pairs in length, and have been found in or near approximately **40%** of promoters of mammalian genes. Over **60%** of human genes and almost all house-keeping genes have their promoters embedded in CpG islands.
- Howver, not all 30,000 CGIs are unmethylated. ~9,000 CGIs within gene bodies (intragenic) are more likely to become methylated, serving a role to regulate transcritional activity during differentiation and disease (Jeziorska et al., 2017). 

- Large undermethylated regions (average methylation <10%) that are longer than 3,500 bp are terms as "canyon" (10 times larger than a typical CGI of ~300 bp)
