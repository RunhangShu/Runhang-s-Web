1. 大地之上 - _A fine balanced_ by Rohinton Mistry (Indian-born Canadian). Rate: 9, I do not remember what is the last time I read such a moved book

2. 现代医学小史 - _A Short History of Medicine_ by Frank Gonzalez-Crussi (Mexican). Rate: 7
3. _Ingenious Patents_  Rate: 5, this book has many vague descriptions and even flaws about the mechanisms of great inventions...quickly skimed through within a day
4. _Evolving ourselvese_ by Enriquez and Gullans
