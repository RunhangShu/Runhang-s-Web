1. 大地之上 - _A fine balanced_ by Rohinton Mistry (Indian-born Canadian). Rate: 9, I do not remember what is the last time I read such a moved book

2. 现代医学小史 - _A Short History of Medicine_ by Frank Gonzalez-Crussi (Mexican). Rate: 7
3. _Ingenious Patents_  Rate: 5, this book has many vague descriptions and even flaws about the mechanisms of great inventions...quickly skimed through within a day
4. _Evolving ourselvese_ by Enriquez and Gullans Rate: 8. The main concept of this book is to argue that Darwin's theory of origin is no longer hold true in modern society, where a lot of human activities drive unnatural selection and non-random mutation. The only thing I dislike is a few chapters are slightly overlapped and redundant. A book I will recommend to people with any background (especially, kids into science); a book I will revisit again and again.
5. _Regenesis: how synthetic biology will reinvent nature and ourselves_ by Geogy Church and Ed Regis.
