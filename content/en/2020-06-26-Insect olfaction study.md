&emsp;&emsp;Insects constantly receive external cues and adjust their behavior. When a herbivorous insect is targeting the plants,
it first replies on olfaction to approach the suitable host plants. Rejecting or accepting the plant host is then involved in
gustation and mechanosensation through direct contact. Recent studies have pointed out the gut microbiota contributes to the
host animals' chemosensory responses and behavior. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the effects of
gut microbes on the host central nervous system. Here, I will give a review of available techniques that can be applied in
insect olfaction study.

## Example1

**A fantastic research paper teach you how to study olfactory system in an non-model organism -- _D.suzukii_**

**Marianthi Karageorgi et al., 2017; Curr Biol papper**

### Rational:
1. First, they did a set of behavior assays and found out:
- _D. suzukii_ prefer to lay eggs in ripe/fresh fruit over rotten fruit

</center>
- _D.suzukii_ can tolerate stiffer oviposition site than other Drosophila species
<center>

</center>

2. Have implied changes in mechanosensory of _D. suzukii_, they further examined the olfaction role in oviposition preference.
Odors from ripe strawberries can elicit _D. suzukii_ but not _D. melanogaster_ to lay eggs on plain agar  

3. Last, they applied Gal4/UAS and CRISPR techniques to manipulate _Orco_, the obligate co-receptor in odorant receptor system.
Silencing _Orco_ gene abolished olfaction-induced egg-laying in a non-choice assay but not affect the flies' oviposition preference
in the two-choice egg-laying assay (The flies prefer ripe fruit over rotten fruit). The data suggested odorant cues, in conjunction
with contact chemosensation, contribute to the oviposition behavior of _D. suzukii_ on ripe fruit.


### Experimental approaches:
1. I have to say that it is the beautiful and well-designed behavior assays that make this article published on Current Biology;
2. To verify locomotor activity in mutant flies was not affected, they also did negative geotaxis test - counting how many time the fly acclimated cross the midline of a vail.  
3. To my best knowledge, although _D.suzukii_ study is getting more popular, this is the first paper to date conducted genetic
manipulation using Gal4 and CRISPR on this beast. Specifically, 5' _Orco_ regulatory regions orthologous to those of _D.melanogaster_ were amplified and subsequently cloned into Gal4 transformation vector.  
4. Electroantennography (EAG)
5. Antibody orco protein staining was performed on fly brains and antennae. Imaging on a confocal microscope.
