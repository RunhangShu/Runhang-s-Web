1. 病毒的进化 - Frank Ryan. Rate: 8. It is a good book for non-scientific audiences to understand the concept of symbiosis between virus and human. However, this book does not provide much information about viral evolution, which mismatches the title of this book. 
2. 宇宙 (Cosmos) - Carl Sagan. Rate: 10. Dr. Sagan is one of the most eminent astronomers in the 20th century. Due to my lack of knowledge in the universe and what are expeditions and ambitious projects human beings have launched for exploring alternative migration site in the solar system, I totally did not realize this book was written in the 80th. 
3. 美国对抗美国 - 王沪宁. 这本写于80年代的书充分表明这么多年来美国的社会问题从来就没有变过。黑人问题，毒品和药物滥用，无家可归的赤贫百姓。 
4. 理想国 - 柏拉图。有人说整个西方哲学史都只是柏拉图思想的一个脚注。这本书读起来没有一句话是多余的，原来经典的好书给人的感觉可以如此美妙：时时与这位相隔我千年的思想家产生共鸣。这本书应该反复看，不断翻读，烂熟于心后，基本就能意会到西方制度和意识形态的根本来源！ 
5. Code breaker - Walter Isaacson. Rate: 7. This book revolves around Jennifer Doudna and connects key historical events in the advance of biochemistry spanning over half a century, from the deciphering of the DNA double helix structure to the application of RNA. This book together with the success of Genentech, Inc., gives me quite a lot of confidence about the future of biotech industries and genetic editting.
