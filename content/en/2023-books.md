1. 病毒的进化 - Frank Ryan. Rate: 8. It is a good book for non-scientific audiences to understand the concept of symbiosis between virus and human. However, this book does not provide much information about viral evolution, which mismatches the title of this book. 
2. 宇宙 (Cosmos) - Carl Sagan. Rate: 10. Dr. Sagan is one of the most eminent astronomers in the 20th century. Due to my lack of knowledge in the universe and what are expeditions and ambitious projects human beings have launched for exploring alternative migration site in the solar system, I totally did not realize this book was written in the 80th.
