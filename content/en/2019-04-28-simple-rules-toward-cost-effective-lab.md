&emsp;Yesterday, I came across an article named ["ten simple rules towards healthier research labs"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006914) while I was browsing Twitter. I did not pay much attention to it till this article was in my field of vision again on Wechat. 


&emsp;Though I am not a PI, I always believe I would grow to a PI someday. During the high school life, I realized I a normal person with an average IQ. At that time, I was a young boy of less comfidence without any goal or any ambition oh..., except willing to succeed in the college entrance exam. Thankfully, I grew up quickly in the University. I started thinking independently: What kind of person I really want to be in the future? I told myself I should be fine even I do not know this answer for now as billions of people in the world do not like the jobs they are doing. For me, it is just time to consider this question as early as possible and many people find the answer when they are in their 40s or 50s. 

&emsp;Later, I looked back my childhood, middle school and high school life. The most familar scenari I can memorized was that I was helping other students solving some mathmatics or physics problems. I felt kind of special happiness that I never felt when I solve problems for others. I though everybody has the same feeling like me when I was young but I was wrong. Several years later, I knew that not everyone would like to teach other people or share their knowledge. Second, most of people cannot well convey precise information to others like me. I found my strength and I know teaching is definately not the only way to make me happy but there is nothing better than teaching as a job which I would do it for a lifetime with great passion. 

&emsp;Yet, along with flowers in bloom and breeze, graduation season is upcoming and I am going to transform from an undergraduate to a M.S student. Finally, I would like to quote a saying from [QuYuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_Yuan), one of the most famous Chinese poet in acient China, "the way ahead is long; I see no ending, yet high and low I shall pursue with my will unbending"
