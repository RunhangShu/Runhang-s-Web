&emsp;&emsp;<font color=black>A brand new semester and new year just started. It is hard to believe the coronavirus **2019** is still happily spreading in **2021**. 2021 is the year of the Ox according to Chinese Zodiac. So, hope we will be as energetic as redbull, as "green" as Tesla in Webull. 

Whether you are ready or not, the 2021 spring term has been taken off. First comes first, I need to develop a Clear and Realistic Strategic work plan NOW.</font>

<font color=blue>First of all, ask what are the tools I am missing in my toolkit ha?

- Proficient writing skill 
- Ecological thinking about Microbiome: using math and omics, what's next?
- Presentation and Communication skill
- Have a broad knowledge of biology.(Do not be limited to micorbe and insect)

Note: Ranked according to the importance

<font size=8> P </font>lan Ahead

To-do list:

- Jan: Finalize method, results and intro of SC Paper; Prepare for PhD interviews; Write a mini Lit Review about microbial ecology research;

- Feb: Finalize SC paper and submit to Msystems; Publish a bacterial genome announcement paper with Lyju 

- Mar: Continue the mini review (50 words per day); Apply CALS scholarship 

- April: (Plan a 3-5-days trip to Cancun if two papers are under review)

Note:

- Jan and Feb are obviously the busiest months, my pre-graduation (May to July) schedule will be more flexible with a potential conference and a Mexico trip if two papers get submitted by Feb. 

- 1/11 to 3/5 Comparative Microbial Genomics course, which can be interconnected with the Gene anouncement paper. 

<font size=8> O </font>utside academia - activities that contribute to long-term success:
