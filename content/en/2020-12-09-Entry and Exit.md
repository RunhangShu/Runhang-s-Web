"First half of life, people debut because of good merits;

 Second half of life, people exit because of defects"

Netizen replies:

"First half of life, people are in a trance because others point out their defects; </br> Second half of life, people hold perseverance because they recognized their talent and merits"

 "But! how many people, exit and hide in first half of life because of innocent and confusion, and come into stage slyly and cunningly in second half of life"


Sorry for my poor translation lol, did you get that?

(I assume that Dr. Rao implied that some "big names" in academia lost the credibility because of scientific misconduct.)
