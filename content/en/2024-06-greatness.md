The greatness of human beings is not just that we show love to random people.

The greatness of human beings is that we show love to random people although we also live in the hardest times of our lives. But, we smile to the world. 

这就是世界对我残酷不公，我却温柔面向世界。因为仁者，是无敌的。 

Opportunities are hiding in struggles; thus, suffering makes you stronger, wiser, and more resilient. 

Struggles are perpetual, joy is short-lived; Joy comes from a temporary break from struggles.
