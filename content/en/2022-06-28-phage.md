An understudied field of research has gained increasing attentions recently after scientists saw numerous viral particals in the soil, ocean, bacterial cells and ,etc by using fluorescence electron microscope or transmission electron microscope. The virues that infect bacteria are called bacterialphages or phages, mean "to eat" in Latin. It is now recognized as the most abundant biological entities (not an organism but a molecular machine) on the planet. So, the article will introduce what do we know about them, and what remains mysterious? 

**Lysogeny** is the phage genome nested in bacterial host chromosomes. One copy of phage genome will be made during each replication of a bacterium. Lysogeny phage, or prophage, is usually temperate phage that have a long-term relationship with bacteria. 

**Piggback-the-winner** is a strategy that prophages use to replicate together with the more competitive bacterial hosts. 

**Lysis** occurs when a type of more virulent phage replicates its genome and packaging bacterial genome inside bacterial cells, ending up lysing the cells and releasing all the "free" phages. This type of virulent phage is most studied in the lab than temperate behaviors of prophage in nature enviroments. 

**Kill-the-winner** is a strategy for virulent phages who are typically obligately lytic, killing their hosts after infection. 

**Superinfection exclusion** is an outcome of lysogeny, where the prophage makes the host immune aginst infection by closely related or unrelated phages. 

**Phage can direct the metabolism of its host**

1. The phage genome bears many AMGs (Auxiliary metabolic genes) that can participate in host metabolic pathways. 

2. The interplay between nutrient demand and availability and the plasticity of the metabolic state of "virocell" may influence the lysis-lysogeny decision. For example, during spring-summer seasonal transitions, temperate virues switch from lysogeny to lytic replication as bacterial production increases (Brum et al., 2016). 

3. Virus-encoded tRNA can also serve to enrich the level of tRNAs that match the viral codon usage.
