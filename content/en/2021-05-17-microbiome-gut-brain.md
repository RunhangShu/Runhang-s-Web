In 2017, Leitao-Goncalves et al. (Carlos Ribeiro lab) reported, in [*Plos biology*](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000862#sec002) journal, that *Drosophila melanogaster* deprived of any single eAAs showed strong craving for amino acid-rich food. This protein appetites elicited by eAA absence can be suppressed when supplemented the flies with a single or a combination of commensal bacterium.

This earlier work on microbiome-dependent protein craving indicated essential amino acid (eAAs) and flies' commensal bacteria including *Acetobacter pomorum* and *Lactobacilli* spp. are potent modulators of feeding decisions and reproductive output. 


**Four years later, Kim et al. (Won-Jae Lee lab) revealed one of the mechanisms: [the microbiome-gut-brain axis in response to amino acid deficit](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03522-2).** 

# Thoughts
  - I have been reading this *Nature* paper for two days, the authors did thorough invesitigations. I have no doubt that this work is a whole PhD's four-year project. 
  - The review process is frastrusting long - 14 months!!! from March 2020 to May 2021. 
  -  Won-Jae lee lab seems to have remarkblely similar ideas with Ribeiro's lab yet their behavioral experiments are not the same. The earlier work was eliminating amino acids from a halidic diet and record the flies' yeast preference or amino acid preference. They found that it is eAA, but not other nutrients, control yeast and amino acid preference. Kim et al. (2021), indead, focused on the aminoa acid preference of flies in response to AA deprivation. They first showed AA-deprived flies prefer L-EAAs (which can be metablolized, but are not synthezied internally) over D-EAAs (which cannot be metablized). Furthermore, they introduced a new factor NEAAs (non-essential amino acid) in this question and designed a neat experiment. They showed deprived flies exhibited no preference when given a choice between medium containing D-EAAs and L-NEAAs (non-essential amino acid) and that containing D-EAAs abd D-NEAAs. This means the AA preferece of AA-deprived flies in the 2017 study is resulted from the preference for EAA. 
  -  Importantly, this lab has a strong fly genetics foundation, the approaches that they used to rule out and identify novel machanisms are sound and solid.
