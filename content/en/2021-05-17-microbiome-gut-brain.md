In 2017, Leitao-Goncalves et al. (Carlos Ribeiro lab) reported, in [*Plos biology*](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000862#sec002) journal, that *Drosophila melanogaster* deprived of any single eAAs showed strong craving for amino acid-rich food. This protein appetites elicited by eAA absence can be suppressed when supplemented the flies with a single or a combination of commensal bacterium.

This earlier work on microbiome-dependent protein craving indicated essential amino acid (eAAs) and flies' commensal bacteria including *Acetobacter pomorum* and *Lactobacilli* spp. are potent modulators of feeding decisions and reproductive output. 


**Four years later, Kim et al. (Won-Jae Lee lab) revealed one of the mechanisms: [the microbiome-gut-brain axis in response to amino acid deficit](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03522-2).** 

# Thoughts
  - I have been reading this *Nature* paper for two days, the authors did thorough invesitigations. I have no doubt that this work is a whole PhD's four-year project. 
  - The review process is frastrusting long - 14 months!!! from March 2020 to May 2021. 
  -  Won-Jae lee lab seems to have remarkblely similar ideas with Ribeiro's lab yet their behavioral experiments are not the same. The earlier work was eliminating amino acids from a halidic diet and record the flies' yeast preference or amino acid preference. They found that it is eAA, but not other nutrients, control yeast and amino acid preference. Kim et al. (2021), indead, focused on the aminoa acid preference of flies in response to AA deprivation. They first showed AA-deprived flies prefer L-EAAs (which can be metablolized, but are not synthezied internally) over D-EAAs (which cannot be metablized). Furthermore, they introduced a new factor NEAAs (non-essential amino acid) in this question and designed a neat experiment. They showed deprived flies exhibited no preference when given a choice between medium containing D-EAAs and L-NEAAs (non-essential amino acid) and that containing D-EAAs abd D-NEAAs. This means the AA preferece of AA-deprived flies in the 2017 study is resulted from the preference for EAA. 
  -  Importantly, this lab has a strong fly genetics foundation, the approaches that they used to rule out and identify novel machanisms are sound and solid. 
  -  The most dramatic thing is that the neuropeptite CNMamide, which connect gut and brain as demonstrated by this paper, is also the gene we wanted to test. We have ordered the primer several months ago. See? this is the fun part of science: great mindd think alike (英雄所见略同), we also need to realized that more estabilished lab is likely targetting these genes a couple of years eariler than others. 

# Rationale
  - By doing two-choice foraging assay, they showed amino-acid-deprived flies prefer essential amoni acids (EAAs) not non-essential amino acids (NEAAs), and more specifically L-EAAs (can be metabolized, but are not synthezied internally) not D-EAAs (cannot be metabolized). This observations are certainly based on Leitao-Goncalves et al. (2017) Plos paper while also extended their findings. It is quite big that deprived-flies can distinguish EAAs from NEAAs. These results indicate that inadequate intake of dietary amino acids promotes a compensatory appetite for L-EAAs.
  - To find the mechanism, they inactived a serius of genes and ruled out 1) ichemosensory ionotropic receptor *Ir76b*, which can modulate food preference and consumption; 2) *poxn*, for which the mutants' most taste cells had been transformed into other cell types; 2) *Dh44*-expressing neurons, which detect the nutritional value of sugar. 
  - Neuropeptite CNMa, released from anterior midgut (R2 region, as labeled by GFP), was markedly higher in AA-deprived flies. They also validated the expression of CNMa protein in this region by anti-CNMa immunohistochemistry.
  - What about other CNMa-expresion tissues? They also exmined this and find amino acid deficit did not elicit _CNMa expression_ in fat body or the brain. 
  - They next asked that whether it is EAAs or NEAAs deprivation alone can trigger CNMa expression in the gut? They found the expression of _CNMa_ in the gut and the preference for EAAs were induced specifically by EAA deprviation, but not by NEAA deprivation. This EAA-dependent gene upregulation was further validated by using the calcium-dependent nuclear import of LexA (CaLexA) reporter system. 
  - So far, they have domenstrated the _CNMa_-expressing enterocytes act as nutrient-sensing cells that repond specially to the lack of EAA ingestion.
