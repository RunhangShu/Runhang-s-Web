In 2017, Leitao-Goncalves reported, in [*Plos biology*](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2000862#sec002) journal, that *Drosophila melanogaster* deprived of any single eAAs showed strong craving for amino acid-rich food. This protein appetites elicited by eAA absence can be suppressed when supplemented the flies with a single or a combination of commensal bacterium. This earlier work on microbiome-dependent protein craving indicated essential amino acid (eAAs) and flies' commensal bacteria including *Acetobacter pomorum* and *Lactobacilli* spp. are potent modulators of feeding decisions and reproductive output.
