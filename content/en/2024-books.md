1. 重温了《哲学-科学-常识》- 陈嘉映,rate:10/10. It was not until that I revisited this book for the second time, I realized why some reads are worth reading a thousand times. I cannot say how much resonance I had when I was reading this book. If you want to have global and **philosophical** views of pursuing truth, discovering unknowns, and later developing into modern science. You will also appreciate why the highest degree in science is called a PhD, Doctor of **Philosophy**.
