1. 重温了《哲学-科学-常识》- 陈嘉映. Rate:10/10. It was not until that I revisited this book for the second time, I realized why some reads are worth reading a thousand times. I cannot say how much resonance I had when I was reading this book. If you want to have global and **philosophical** views of pursuing truth, discovering unknowns, and later developing into modern science. You will also appreciate why the highest degree in science is called a PhD, Doctor of **Philosophy**.

2. 读了四分之一，由于时间有限和不想阅读pdf，再加上其实我读到的部分仅仅是对苏格兰近代史的一个详细记载，以及它与英格兰的爱恨情仇。最后弃之。

3. A matter of degree - Gino Segre. Rate: 10/10. A book that I was waiting for years to come across. Born in Florence in 1938, Segre lived his earlier childhood in the US because of the anti-semitic laws enacted in Italy. He later went to Havard and MIT for education. His uncle Emilio Segrè is a Nobel laureate physicist. From page to page, I was frequently amazed by how much knowledge Prof. Segre had, ranging from physics to biology. The most fascinating part of this book is that he successfully combined all of the realms in STEM and discussed them under one aspect - **temperature**!
