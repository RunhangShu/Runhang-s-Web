1. 重温了《哲学-科学-常识》- 陈嘉映. Rate:10/10. It was not until that I revisited this book for the second time, I realized why some reads are worth reading a thousand times. I cannot say how much resonance I had when I was reading this book. If you want to have global and **philosophical** views of pursuing truth, discovering unknowns, and later developing into modern science. You will also appreciate why the highest degree in science is called a PhD, Doctor of **Philosophy**.

2. 读了四分之一，由于时间有限和不想阅读pdf，再加上其实我读到的部分仅仅是对苏格兰近代史的一个详细记载，以及它与英格兰的爱恨情仇。最后弃之。

3. A matter of degree - Gino Segre. Rate: 10/10. A book that I was waiting for years to come across. Born in Florence in 1938, Segre lived his earlier childhood in the US because of the anti-semitic laws enacted in Italy. He later went to Havard and MIT for education. His uncle Emilio Segrè is a Nobel laureate physicist. From page to page, I was frequently amazed by how much knowledge Prof. Segre had, ranging from physics to biology. The most fascinating part of this book is that he successfully combined all of the realms in STEM and discussed them under one aspect - **temperature**!

4. 经典费曼 - Rate: 10/10. This book vividly revealed the personalities of this great American physicist, artist, and mathematician Dr. Feynman. Interesting and amazing personal stories and unique life experiences all made this person well-rounded in many aspects such as **building the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project, playing drums in Brazil during his one-year sabbatical, sketching live nude models in Pasadena, winning a Nobel prize, inspecting NASA's 1986 *Space shuttle Challenger* accident, picking up Las Vegas showgirls**...
Anyhow, his life cannot be copied. I believe it is a kind of life that many people would envy while he probably created many enemies on the road of finding the truth (the NASA disaster case).

He said that "nature cannot be fooled". He thinks "being-unknowing is better than knowing a wrong answer" because scientific knowledge has different levels of certainty. Some are uncertain, some are largely certain, but nothing is completely certain. 
Again, when I was reading this book I was often surprised by how wide were his interests and how acute was his intellect.
