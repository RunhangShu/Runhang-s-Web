Many yogurt products contain probiotics (a mixture of benificial bacteria) are advertising they have **billions of live bacteria** in the bottle. Intrigued by the question that how many **live** bacteria are still there by the time that I got my yogurt from the grocery store, I start to quantify the number of bacteria in my favoriate yogurt brand Activia Probiotic Dailies. I like it because it is liquid and I can just dump it into my gut without the need of a spoon, which is required for typical greek style yogurt. 

## CFU assay 
From one bottle of vanilla flavored ACTIVIA, I did 1:10000 dilution and spread 80 microliters onto LB and BHI agar plates. After an overnight incubation at 37C, around 2,000 of colonies grow on the plate. So, lets do a simple calculation: each ml of the drink will have 2,000 x 10000 x 1000ul/80ul = 2.5 x 10^8 CFU/ml. So a bottle of ACTIVIA (91.6ml) have 2.29 x 10^10 bacteria that can grow on LB/BHI plates. So, at least in the sample I was selecting have ~23 billions bacteria. Bear in mind that some of bacteria may not grow in the LB/BHI media that I am providing.
