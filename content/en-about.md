Hey！🔥Welcome to Runhang's base🔥

\
   I obtained my M.S. focusing #insect#microbe#nutrtion#behavior at the Univ. of Florida at [Wong
lab.](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-cn-wong/) Now, I am a 1st-year Ph.D student at [UCI CMB program.](https://cmb.uci.edu/) I was co-advised by Katrine Whiteson and Charles Glabe for the Fall 2021. I rotated in Wei Li lab for the Winter 2021. I am rotating in Albert Siryaporn lab for the Spring 2022. 


**Research interests**

***Do microbe modulate our behavior?*** 
We are living a microbial world where all animals are intimately
associated with microbes. The animal hosts have co-evolved with the
microbes inhabiting in their body (i.e. gut). While human genome is hard
to edit, the gut microbial community and its collective genetic
materials are easy to amend through diet (prebiotics) and probiotics
(dietary beneficial microbes), providing novel tactcics to improve human
health. Given the epidemic of obesity worldwide and high sugar
diet-shaped gut microbiome that could alter our feeding behavior, my
goal is to use *Drosophila* model to illunimate the underlying
mechanisms of microbiome-mediated host physiology (e.g. nutritional
state and appetite).

***Microbiome ecology.*** 
To translate the study of experimental models into clinical practice
(Lactobacillus represents a good example), we have to study microbiome
ecology! Our understanding of microbiome ecology is extremely limited
such as gut microbial community is composed of \>1000 bacterial taxa
(some fungi&virus). It remains largely unknown whether the interactions
of such an intricated network are highly personalized or universal
across human. Furthermore, despite the gut microbiome intrapersonal
variation is smaller than that of interpersonal variation, two sets of
microbiome could exert similar functions, as known as functional
redundancy of microbiome. The functional redundancy of the gut
microbiome adds another layer of complexity to gut microbiome ecology.
There is an urgent call for multi-disciplinary collaborations in
microbiome study across different systems (soil, ocean, plant, animals).
On top of continuous efforts in sequencing, bacteria genome editing, and
clinic trails, I believe, mathematical modeling and simulation can
provide great insights about designing a personalized microbial cocktail
for human health.

***Microbiome and host epigenome.*** 
Microbe and human share very similar langugae in the epigenetic modifications. Besides, many of microbiome-derived metabolites are involved in the biological process of epigenetic programming. The role of the cross-kingdom communication in driving many diseases including cancer has been unfolding. My goal is to apply computational tools to identify microbiome-associated links between epigenetic markers and diseases. These epigenetic markers and microbiome signature provide both cancer early diagosis and potential microbiome-based treatments. 

**Advocation**

-   "Understanding how microbes affect health and the biosphere requires
    an international initiative" - Nicole Dubilier, Margaret
    McFall-Ngai, and Liping Zhao
-   Transparent datasets and transparent methodology are fundamental for
    the advancement of science.

-   "Science not communicated is science not done" - Mellisa Marshall

We all love science and cherish that this is the greatest time to do
science. Importantly, we should also TALK about science, SHARE ideas,
and keep CRITICIZing.

  Here, I will log my thoughts on general science and my research field. The website will witness my personal progress and the development of my own research philosophy and life philosophy.
