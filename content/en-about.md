Hey！🔥Welcome to Runhang's base🔥

\
   In 2021, I earned my Master's degree focusing on host-microbe interactions at the Univ. of Florida at [Wong lab.](http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-cn-wong/). Then, I was admitted to the [UCI CMB program.](https://cmb.uci.edu/), a PhD gateway program. I rotated in three labs and became a PhD candidate in Sep. 2024. In Albert Siryaporn's lab, I am studying bacteriophages associated with *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, a key pathogen causing chronic lung infection. 


**Research interests**

***Do microbes modulate our behavior?*** 
We are living in a microbial world where all animals are intimately
associated with microbes. The animal hosts have co-evolved with the
microbes inhabiting their body (i.e. gut). While the human genome is hard
to edit, the gut microbial community and its collective genetic
materials are easy to amend through diet (prebiotics) and probiotics
(dietary beneficial microbes), providing novel tactics to improve human
health. Given the epidemic of obesity worldwide and high sugar
the diet-shaped gut microbiome that could alter our feeding behavior, my
goal is to use *Drosophila* model to illuminate the underlying
mechanisms of microbiome-mediated host physiology (e.g. nutritional
state and appetite).

***Microbiome and host epigenome.*** 
Microbes and humans share very similar language in epigenetic modifications. Besides, many microbiome-derived metabolites are involved in the biological process of epigenetic programming. The role of cross-kingdom communication in driving many diseases including cancer has been unfolding. My goal is to apply computational tools to identify microbiome-associated links between epigenetic markers and diseases. These epigenetic markers and microbiome signature provide both cancer early diagosis and potential microbiome-based treatments. 

**Advocation**

-   "Understanding how microbes affect health and the biosphere requires
    an international initiative" - Nicole Dubilier, Margaret
    McFall-Ngai, and Liping Zhao
-   Transparent datasets and transparent methodology are fundamental for
    the advancement of science.

-   "Science not communicated is science not done" - Mellisa Marshall

We all love science and cherish the fact that this is the greatest time to do
science. Importantly, we should also TALK about science, SHARE ideas,
and keep CRITICIZing.

  Here, I will log my thoughts on general science and my research field. The website will witness my progress and the development of my research philosophy and life philosophy.
